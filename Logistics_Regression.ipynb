        "1. What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
        "  - Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables: one independent (predictor) variable and one dependent (response) variable. Its purpose is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable by fitting a straight line to the data.\n",
        "2. What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "  - The key assumptions of SLR are:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.\n",
        "    - Independence: Observations are independent of each other.\n",
        "    - Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variable.\n",
        "    - Normality: The residuals are normally distributed.\n",
        "3. Write the mathematical equation for a simple linear regression model and explain each term.\n",
        "  - The equation is:\n",
        "    - y = β₀ + β₁x + ε\n",
        "\n",
        "    - y: Dependent variable (response)\n",
        "    - x: Independent variable (predictor)\n",
        "    - β₀: Intercept (value of y when x = 0)\n",
        "    - β₁: Slope (change in y for a one-unit change in x)\n",
        "    - ε: Error term (residuals)   \n",
        "4. Provide a real-world example where simple linear regression can be applied.\n",
        "  - A real-world example is predicting house prices based on square footage. Here, square footage is the independent variable, and house price is the dependent variable. SLR helps estimate how much the price increases for each additional square foot.  \n",
        "5. What is the method of least squares in linear regression?\n",
        "  - The method of least squares is used to find the best-fitting line in linear regression by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model. It ensures the line is as close as possible to all data points.\n",
        "6. What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        "  - Logistic Regression is used for binary classification problems where the outcome is categorical (e.g., yes/no, 0/1). It models the probability of a binary outcome using a logistic function. Unlike Linear Regression, which predicts continuous values, Logistic Regression predicts probabilities bounded between 0 and 1.\n",
        "7. Name and briefly describe three common evaluation metrics for regression models.\n",
        "  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
        "  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
        "  - R-squared (R²): Proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable(s).\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the R-squared metric in regression analysis?\n",
        "  - R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It indicates how well the regression model fits the data, with values ranging from 0 to 1 (higher values mean better fit).\n",

        "  - In a simple linear regression model, the coefficients represent the relationship between the independent variable (predictor) and the dependent variable (target). Specifically:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The intercept (β₀) is the expected value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. It is the point where the regression line crosses the y-axis.\n",
        "    - The slope (β₁) indicates the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit increase in the independent variable. For example, if the slope is 2, then for every one-unit increase in the independent variable, the dependent variable increases by 2 units.\n",
        "  - These coefficients help quantify the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the variables. A positive slope indicates a positive relationship, while a negative slope indicates a negative relationship."
